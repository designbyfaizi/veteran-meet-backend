**VeteranMeet** is **Web-based solution** to connect with veterans and engage them into community
services based on their interests. A veteran is a person who has had long service or experience in a particular occupation or field. This application will help
veterans of any profession to connect with other veterans and socialize through our platform and can participate into any community services such public talks, motivational speeches into
educational institutions and organization, plantation drive and picnic etc. Additionally, they can take initiate a new community service and can involve other veterans into it.

## Motivation

Generally, Senior professionals donâ€™t get involved into any sort of work after retirement. Rather, they tend to stay at home and spend time with their home activities. It often leads them towards a **monotonous** and **boredom** routine. Momentarily, this sedentary lifestyle may cause health problems among retired people. Hence, it is necessary to keep them engage into some positive and constructive community services which will preserve them active and energetic. Veteran Meet will be a web based solution for these veterans which aims to connect them with other veterans of their own profession and it will also help them to participate into any community
service based on their interest.
